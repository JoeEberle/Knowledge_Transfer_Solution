Here’s the updated version with the additional section included:

---

1. **Cloned the Existing Repository**:  
   I began by cloning the original repository to my local environment, allowing me to work on it independently.

2. **Extended the Solution README**:  
   After cloning, I enhanced the README file by adding more detailed information about the solution, including its usage, features, and functionality.

3. **Tested the Solution**:  
   I tested the solution thoroughly using the appropriate dataset to ensure it functions as expected. The solution worked perfectly during my testing.

4. **Renamed the Repository**:  
   I renamed the repository from `solution_name` to `solution_name_sn` to reflect the updated solution and distinguish it from the original.

5. **Rebranded the Project**:  
   I rebranded the project and solution to align with the target company’s brand image and likeness. This included updating logos, color schemes, and naming conventions to match the company’s branding. Additionally, I transferred any relevant contact points and URLs to the target company.

6. **Made the Repository Private and Invited Collaborators**:  
   I made the repository private to protect its content and then invited the target company as collaborators, allowing them access to the repository.

7. **Transferred Ownership to the Target Company**:  
   Finally, I transferred ownership of the repository to the target company via GitHub (`github.com`), ensuring they have full control over the repository moving forward.

---

This version now includes the rebranding step and transfer of contact points and URLs as requested.
